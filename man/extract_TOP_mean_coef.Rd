\title{Extract the posterior mean coefficients for each level of TOP model}
\usage{
extract_TOP_mean_coef(
  TOP_samples,
  tf_cell_combos,
  assembled_training_data,
  n.bins = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{TOP_samples}{TOP samples combined from all partitions using
\code{combine_TOP_samples}.}

\item{tf_cell_combos}{A table with the indices and names of TF and cell type
combinations from the assembled training data. If missing,
will extract from assembled_training_data.}

\item{assembled_training_data}{Assembled training data as in the
\code{assemble_training_data} function.}

\item{n.bins}{Number of DNase or ATAC bins in TOP model (default = 5)}
}
\value{
A list of posterior mean coefficients at each level of TOP model.
}
\description{
Extract alpha and beta coefficients from TOP posterior samples,
and return the mean of coefficients at each level of TOP model.
