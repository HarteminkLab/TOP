\title{Predict TF binding probability by TOP logistic model}
\usage{
predict_TOP_logistic_mean_coef(data, mean_coef)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing motif PWM score and DNase (or ATAC) bins.}

\item{mean_coef}{A numeric vector. The posterior mean of trained regression
coefficients, including the intercept and coefficients for PWM score and
DNase (or ATAC) bins.
length(mean_coef) should be equal to 1+ncol(data).}
}
\value{
A data frame of input data and predicted TF binding probability.
}
\description{
Predict TF binding probability using posterior mean of the regression
coefficients trained from TOP logistic model.
}
\examples{
predictions <- predict_TOP_logistic_mean_coef(data, # data frame of input data.
                                              mean_coef)  # (selected) pretrained posterior mean of TOP regression coefficients
