Description: Transcription factor (TF) occupancy profiler (TOP) 
    predicts quantitative TF occupancy at candidate TF motif locations 
    across cell types or conditions.
    It is a Bayesian hierarchical model trained using quantitative 
    DNase- or ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data 
    from many TFs and cell types (from ENCODE data).
    TOP learns both TF- and cell type- specific parameters as well 
    as TF-generic parameters jointly for TFs and cell types from existing 
    DNase-/ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data. 
    Once trained, it could predict quantitative TF occupancy or 
    TF binding probability for TFs across cell types or conditions 
    using DNase- or ATAC- seq data
    without requring new ChIP data.
