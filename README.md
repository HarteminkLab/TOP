# Transcription factor Occupancy Profiler (TOP)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Transcription factor Occupancy Profiler (TOP) fits a Bayesian
hierarchical model using transcription factor (TF) motif information,
DNase or ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from multiple TFs across multiple
cell types or conditions.

It can be used to predict the quantitative occupancy (or TF binding
probability) for many TFs using data from a single DNase- or ATAC-seq
experiment.
